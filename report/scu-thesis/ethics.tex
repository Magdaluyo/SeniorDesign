\chapter{Ethics}

The purpose of this project was to address the ethical issue of accessibility when it comes to people with hearing impairments and doorbells. This is best examined with the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics Justice and Fairness approach \cite{website:markkula}. The relevant factors within the Justice and Fairness approach in this case include effort, contribution, and need. In terms of effort, we recognize that those with hearing impairments need to place more effort in order to be alerted about visitors without this system. This also creates a burden on other residents, so this system can lift the burden from all residents once properly set up in regards to visitors approaching. When thinking about contributions, we observed that this population has less opportunities to contribute to their community due to the inability to hear a doorbell. This system puts hearing impaired residents in a position of choice when responding to visitors. Since this is a proof of concept, we addressed the immediate needs of the hearing impaired community in regards to a doorbell. We look forward to users getting hands on with the system in order to better address their needs and concerns to better add and adjust features in the future.
