\chapter{Lessons Learned}

We learned a lot about the IoT world. Before this project, we werenâ€™t even aware of 802.15.4 which became the main communication protocol in our system. We also learned to make radical changes to the system where necessary when the original plan does not work. Finally, we learned the different advantages and disadvantages to how IoT devices are currently implemented.
