\begin{abstract}
Doorbell solutions for hearing impaired individuals is seriously limited. Affordable solutions are not effective and higher end solutions are not affordable for most hearing impaired individuals and are not designed primarily with them in mind. In this report, we propose our design for an affordable solution that would also be much more effective in bringing hearing-impaired users to attention that someone is at the door. Furthermore, We propose a simple solution that would also allow for more devices to be integrated into the system enabling better notifications using the MQTT application layer protocol.
