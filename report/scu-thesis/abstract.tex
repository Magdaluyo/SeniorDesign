\begin{abstract}
Doorbell options for hearing impaired individuals is seriously limited. Affordable solutions are not scalable while other solutions are expensive. With this in mind, we designed a scalable and affordable system that will be beneficial to hearing impaired individuals in a small aspect of their life. Our solution takes advantage of affordable IoT devices and software to build a proof of concept. Due to the scope of the project, we only designed a proof of concept, in the hope that a company can design a viable product that will not only benefit hearing impaired individuals but bring a powerful IoT system to the homes of others.
