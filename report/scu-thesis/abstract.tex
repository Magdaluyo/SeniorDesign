\begin{abstract}
Doorbell solutions for hearing impaired individuals is seriously limited. Affordable solutions are not effective and higher end solutions are not affordable for most hearing impaired individuals and are not designed primarily with them in mind. In this report, we propose our design for an affordable solution that would also be much more effective in bringing users to attention that someone is at the door. We propose a simple solution that would also allow for more devices to notify users.
