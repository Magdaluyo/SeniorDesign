\chapter{Activity Diagrams}

\section{Description}
The activity diagrams show the potential paths of actions a user may take with the system. For the Resident actor (Figure \ref{fig:residentdiagram}), upon turning on a system, the user may register or remove devices. The system will be then available and a user may receive a response when the doorbell is pressed. From any of these actions a user may take, they may also power the system off.

For the Visitor actor (Figure \ref{fig:visitordiagram}), when the system is on, the user will be able to activate the doorbell by a button and have one of the connected devices respond to the Resident actor.
