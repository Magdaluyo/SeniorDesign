\chapter{Test Plan}

\section{Description}
This chapter discusses methods in which we plan to test our system from unit testing to system testing. We will spend most of our time testing the system in small pieces. We will have to make sure that each type of device can be registered with the system and function.

\section{Unit Testing}
We will be testing our system in small individual processes. These would be things such as if an individual script performs properly in our system. We would also have to verify that devices work as we expected.

\section{Functional Testing}
We will be testing our system in small units. This will have to do with verifying that a device can be activated to notify the Resident actor or that a button triggers a software action properly.

\section{Component Testing}
We will be testing our system by use cases. We expect to put together multiple functional components such as a device turning on and a button interrupt triggering the device.

\section{System Testing}
Finally, we will test the system as a whole. We would set it up in a house and verify that all the use cases perform properly. We will limit testing to just one device and once all of those are successful, move on to testing multiple devices at one time.
