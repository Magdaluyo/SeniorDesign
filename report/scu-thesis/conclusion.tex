\chapter{Conclusion}

The main goal of the project was to improve the lives of the hearing impaired individuals. In most systems, scalability and affordability do not coincide often. Affordability was extremely important to us so that we can reach a wider audience. By using affordable, powerful devices and software we were able to achieve this. Considering the time for this project, building a solution from the ground up was out of the picture. Therefore, we hope this can be an inspiration for an affordable IoT system that the hearing impaired community can take advantage of, while also being an affordable IoT home system for any user, bringing IoT home applications to more users.
