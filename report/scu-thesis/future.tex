\chapter{Future Work}

\section{Current State}
Our project is a working proof of concept for a successful affordable option for hearing impaired individuals. It is not  a perfect system and components have more than is needed driving up costs; however, the benefit is that we use easily available devices that others can use to build upon the product. Since Node-RED is open source, members of the community can easily add nodes that benefit from our system.

\section{Next Steps}
Since the architecture is in place, a company could build a viable product. The main missing part to our system is a completely functioning smartphone application. The purpose of the smartphone application is to abstract user control of the system. The functionalities are all possible but scripts have to be made to modify the necessary parts of the Node-RED application.
