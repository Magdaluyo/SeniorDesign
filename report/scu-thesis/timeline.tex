\chapter{Development Timeline}

\section{Description}
In this chapter, we show (Table \ref{table:timeline}) the development timeline of the system. Each light blue header marks a academic quarter and the work is divided up by the weeks in a quarter. We struggled to keep up with these deadlines due to obstacles encountered as described in a future chapter. Fortunately, we were still able to get a working system in time, albeit with less testing than intended.
